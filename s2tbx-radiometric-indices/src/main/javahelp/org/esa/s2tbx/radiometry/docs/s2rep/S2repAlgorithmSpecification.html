<h3>S2REP</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>S</b></u>entinel-<b>2</b> <u><b>R</b></u>ed-<u><b>E</b></u>dge <u><b>P</b></u>osition <b>I</b></u>ndex algorithm was developed for applications in biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake measurment/management in heterogeneous fields. <br><br>

    Red edge, as the inflection point of the strong red absorption to near infrared reflectance, includes the information of both crop N and growth status. <br>
    The reflectance around red edge is sensitive to wide range of crop chlorophyll content, N content, LAI and biomass (Hatfield et al., 2008; Mutanga and Skidmore, 2007; Steele et al., 2008b) <br><br>

</p>


<p>
    The S2REP results from the following (Sensor-dependent) equation: <br><br>
</p>

<p>

    <b>S2REP = 705 + 35 * ( (red1_factor * red1 + IR_factor * near_IR)/2) - red2_factor * red2 ) / (red3_factor * red3 - red2_factor * red2) )</b><br><br>

</p>

<p>
    For <b>Sentinel-2</b> the formula is: <br><br>
    <b>705 + 35 * ((B4 + B7)/2 - B5) / (B6 - B5)</b>, where (Central wavelength/Bandwidth): B7 =  783 nm (15 nm), B6 = 740 nm (15 nm), B5 = 705 nm (15 nm), B4 = 665 nm (30 nm) <br><br>

</p>


<h3>S2REP-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 's2rep_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for S2REP is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for S2REP is less than 0 (zero)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for S2REP is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>

<h3>Offset Tracking Operator</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">The Offset Tracking operator estimates
the movement of glacier surfaces between two SAR images in both
slant-range and azimuth direction. It performs cross-correlation on
selected GCP-patches in master and slave images, and computes glacier
velocities based on the shift computed for each GCP. Finally the
glacier velocity map is computed through interpolation of the
velocities computed for the GCP grid.<br>
</div>
<h4>Parameters Used</h4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parameters used by the operator are as follows:
<ol>

  <li>Grid Azimuth Spacing: The GCP grid azimuth spacing in pixels.</li>
  <li>Grid Range Spacing: The GCP grid range spacing in pixels. </li>
  
  <li>Registration Window Width: The window width for
cross-correlation. </li>
<li>Registration Window Height: The window height for
cross-correlation. </li>
  <li>Cross-Correlation Threshold: Threshold
for normalized cross-correlation value. If the cross-correlation value
is greater than the threshold, then the estimated offset is
considered valid, otherwise invalid. <br>
</li>
  <li>Average Box Size: Size of sliding window for averaging offsets computed for GCPs. </li>
  <li>Max Velocity: The maximum allowed glacier velocity in meters per day. It is used in eliminating outliers.<br>
</li>
  <li>Radius for Hole Filling: It defines the size of the window
for hole filling. For GCP that has no valid offset, a window with given
radius centered at the GCP is defined. Offsets from valid GCPs within
the window are used in interpolating the offset for the current GCP.<br>

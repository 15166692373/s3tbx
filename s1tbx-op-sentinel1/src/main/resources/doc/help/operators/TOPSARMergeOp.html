<h3>Sentinel-1 TOPSAR Merge</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For the
TOPSAR IW
and EW SLC products, each product consists of one image per swath per
polarization. IW products have 3 swaths and EW have 5 swaths. Each
sub-swath
image consists of a series of bursts, where each burst was processed as
a
separate SLC image. The individually focused complex burst images are
included,
in azimuth-time order, into a single sub-swath image, with black-fill
demarcation in between, similar to the ENVISAT ASAR Wide ScanSAR SLC
products.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the current toolbox, most operators in the
TOPS InSAR processing chain operate on split product. For example with
"TOPSAR Coreg Interferogram" graph, debursted interferogram for a given
sub-swath is obtained. The TOPSAR Merge operator merges the debursted
split product of different sub-swaths into on complete product. The
merge happens only in range in the same fashion as in TOPSAR Deburst
operator.<br>

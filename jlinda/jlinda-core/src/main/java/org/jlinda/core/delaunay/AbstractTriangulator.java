/**
 * Base class for Delaunay Triangulation implementations.
 * In mathematics, and computational geometry, a Delaunay triangulation for
 * a set P of points in the plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point
 * in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay
 * triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles
 * in the triangulation; they tend to avoid skinny triangles.

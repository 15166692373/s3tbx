<h3>The user interface</h3>
<p>The interface consists in 3 screens which allow the following operations: create new adapter, edit, duplicate and
    delete an existing adapter, executing an adapter.</p>

<h4>Managing the existing adapters</h4>
<p>This form, having the title <i>'External tools'</i>, lists all the currently defined adapters, with a toolbar which contains
    the buttons: new adapter, duplicate adapter, edit adapter, execute adapter, delete adapter. Under the toolbar,
    there is a table containing the adapters where the user can check the adapter to apply the action form the toolbar.
    If multiple adapters are checked, the action is applied to the first checked one.</p>
<p>This form can be invoked by using the menu <i>Tools->Manage external tools</i> of the SNAP application.</p>
<img src="../images/ManageAdapters.JPG"/>
<h4>Creating a new adapter or modifying an existing one</h4>
<p>The form for creating a new adapter is reused for editing an existing adapter and for duplicating an adapter.</p>
<img src="../images/EditAdapter.png"/>
<p>The form is structured into multiple areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>descriptor details</li>
    <li>system variables</li>
    <li>pre-processing</li>
    <li>configuration</li>
    <li>tool output patterns</li>
    <li>parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>For details about the operator structure and what is the use of each member, see <a href="user_interface.html">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Descriptor details</h5>
<p>This area consists in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alias: a short name for the adapter to distinguish from the rest of the adapters, this alias will be used to
        name the folder on disk where the operator resides, so special characters should not be used (for example,
        on windows, the following characters are not allowed when defining a folder name: <>:"/\|?*). This is a
        required field.</li>
    <li>Unique Name: this name is a name which registers the adapter in the toolbox. It must be unique. This is a
        required field.</li>
    <li>Label: is the user-friendly name. This field is not required.</li>
    <li>Version:</li>
    <li>Copyright:</li>
    <li>Authors:</li>
    <li>Description:</li>
    <li>Menu Location: this represents the path to the menu where the tool shortcut will be placed. Usually,
        this should be <i>Tool/External tools/ToolAlias</i></li>
</ul>
<h5>System variables</h5>
<p>System variables is a table containing the variables that must be set when the tools is executed. A new
    variable can be added by using the <b>+</b> button and an existing one can be deleted by using the delete button
    (<b>X</b>) in the left of the desired variable. The key and value of an variable can be edited by double-clicking
    the corresponding cell.</p>
<h5><b>Pre-processing</b> area contains 2 field, each one with a checkbox and a combobox:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Preprocessing tool: when this option is checked and an already defined tool is chosen in the combobox,
        that tool is executed with the same input parameters values as the current tool, as the first step of the
        execution of the current adapter.</li>
    <li>Write before preprocessing: when this option is checked and a writer is selected in the combobox, the product
        is written to disk as the second step of the execution of the current adapter. The path where the product is
        saved is given as the value of the parameter <i>sourceProductFile</i></li>	
</ul>
<h5>Configuration parameters includes:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Tool location: location of the executable file corresponding to the tool.</li>
    <li>Working directory: the place where the temporary files are saved</li>
    <li>Command line template: the velocity template to be executed, including the command line arguments of the tool,
        each one of them on a separate line. The content of the template is saved in a file called
        <i>&lt;operator_alias&gt;_template.vm</i> under the folder of the operator.</i></li>
</ul>
<h5>Tool output patterns</h5>
<p>Tool output patterns includes 2 defined patterns for determining the progress of the tool and also the
    error status. When the tool outputs something, the two patterns are checked and if one of them matches the output,
    this is registered in the log (in SNAP application, when the Console is active, the log messages will appear
    in the console view)</p>
<h5>Operator parameters</h5>
<p>This area consists in a table of parameters necessary for the processing of the velocity template. Each parameter
    can have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>description</li>
    <li>label</li>
    <li>data type</li>
    <li>default value</li>
</ul>
<p>The data type of a parameter can be as follows:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Special use-case</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Integer</td><td>Integer values</td><td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Decimal</td><td>Float values</td><td>N/A</td>

    <tr>
        <td>String</td><td>A list of characters</td><td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Boolean</td><td>The control of this type is a checkbox, so the accepted values are true and false.</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>List</td><td>This type represents a list of strings, delimited by comma.</td><td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Template Parameter</td>
        <td>the template parameters are velocity templates that need to be interpreted
        before the execution of the tool. The interpreted result will be saved on local disk, in the temporary folder
        of the adapter. The full path of the result file will be saved as this parameter's value, so when the parameter is
        used in the tool template, it will be replaced with the full path of the interpreted result.</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Template Before</td>
        <td>this is a velocity template which will be interpreted before the execution of the tool.</td>
        <td>It can be used to create/copy some files necessary for the execution, or to...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Template After</td><td>this is a velocity template which will be executed after the tool execution.</td>
        <td>It can be used to delete some temporary files that were used to the actual execution (for example
            temporary products - see ... parameter type), or to do some operations with the result of the execution
            (like renaming the file containing the final product)
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Product List</td>
        <td>Represents a product loaded in SNAP application context (or a list of loaded products)</td>
        <td>This type is not available in the parameter type combobox, instead only the default parameter called
            'sourceProduct' has this type (see section <b>Default parameters</b>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>File List</td>
        <td>Represents a file or a list of files</td>
        <td>This type is not available in the parameter type combobox, instead only the default parameter called
            'sourceProductFile' has this type (see section <b>Default parameters</b>)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h5>Default parameters</h5>
<p>An adapter must have 3 parameters. If the descriptor of the adapter does not contain one or all of this parameters,
    they are added when the editing form is launched. Those parameters are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        sourceProduct - represents the product(s) choosed by the user from the ones loaded in SNAP context on the
        time of the execution (see <b>Executing an adapter</b> for details about how to choose a product). When this
        parameter is used in the velocity template, for each product the method <b>getFileLocation()</b> is called, and
        the path returned by the method is passed to the velocity template. If there are multiple source products,
        each one is accessed by using the syntax sourceProduct[0], sourceProduct[1], ... This parameter cannot be
        edited or deleted.
    </li>
    <li>
        sourceProductFile - this is a File or a list of files corresponding to the source products chosed on execution.
        This is used only if 'Write product with' is checked and a writer is chosed. When this happens, all the source
        products are written on disk, in the temporary folder, and the absolute path of the file(s) is stored in
        this parameter, so it can be used in the velocity template. This parameter cannot be edited or deleted.</li>
</ul>

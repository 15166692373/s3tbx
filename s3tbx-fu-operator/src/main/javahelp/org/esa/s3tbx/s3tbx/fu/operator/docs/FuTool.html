<p>This algorithm is used for deriving the hue angle and FU (Forel-Ule) value from OLCI, MERIS, SeaWiFS and MODIS data
    with the use of weighted linear sum of the remote sensing reflectance in which visual bands plus a correction term
    for the specific band-setting of each instrument. The algorithm is validated by a set of 603 hyperspectral
    measurements from inland, coastal and near-ocean waters.

Sentinel-3 Toolbox Release Notes
================================

Changes in S3TBX 5.0
--------------------

###New Features and Important Changes
* **AATSR Regridding Tool**
AATSR data is acquired with a conical scanning geometry. To display the acquisitions as a raster image the raw data is 
transformed into a gridded L1 TOA product at a resolution of 1 km. This "gridding" modifies the exact pixel position and resolution. 
This Tool allows the “re-gridding” of the AATSR data back into their original instrument geometries. 
* **Rayleigh Correction Processor for OLCI and MERIS**
This new operator allows the correction of the rayleigh scattering for OLCI and MERIS.
* **OWT Processor**
This processor, developed by Timothy Moore (University of New Hampshire), calculates optical water types. The classification is 
based on atmospherically corrected reflectances.
* **FUB Processor**
This processor retrieves case II water and atmospheric properties for MERIS. It has been developed by Thomas Schroeder and 
Michael Schaale from Freie Universitaet Berlin.
* **PROBA-V Toolbox**
This new toolbox is intended for the exploitation of PROAB-V data. Therefore the PROBA-V reader has been moved from the 
Sentinel-3 Toolbox into the PROBA-V Toolbox. If you still need the reader you have to install the toolbox. 
* **IDEPIX extended for more sensors**
The pixel identification tool IDEPIX has been extended to support more sensors. Among the supported sensors are now: 
MERIS, OLCI, VIIRS, PROAB-V, SeaWiFS and SPOT-VGT

Changes in S3TBX 4.0
--------------------

###New Features and Important Changes
* New colour classification based on the Forel–Ule scale has been implement for OLCI, MERIS, 
  SeaWiFS and MODIS. Thanks to Hendrik Jan van der Woerd and Marcel R. Wernand from the Royal 
  Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NOIZ) for the algorithm and the validation. 
* The Sentinel-3 Reader have been improved according errors and format changes have been adapted.
* The fractional Land/Water Mask operator has been moved into SNAP because of its general usability.          

### Solved issues
####Bugs

    [SIIITBX-112] - Reprojecting SLSTR L1B products with tie-point geo-codings creates shifts within images
    [SIIITBX-113] - S3 SLSTR WST should not use valid mask for its geo-coding

####New Feature
    [SIIITBX-114] - Integrate the colour classification based on discrete Forel–Ule scale

####Task
    [SIIITBX-107] - Move Land/water mask operator into SNAP

    [SIIITBX-104] - Cloud operator should consistently use the system logger


Changes in S3TBX 3.0
--------------------

###New Features and Important Changes
* The Idepix Processor provides a pixel classification into properties such as clear/cloudy, land/water, snow, ice etc. The processing 
options/parameters as well as the underlying classification algorithms are instrument-dependent. The Idepix Processor provided with the current 
SNAP version supports MODIS and Landsat-8.
* The ARC Processor is aimed to enable the user to calculate the sea-surface temperature and Saharan Dust Index from (A)ATSR brightness temperatures.
* The new SLSTR L1B PDU Stitching Tool stitches multiple SLSTR L1B product dissemination units (PDUs) of the same orbit to a single product.
* A new client tool has been developed for accessing online in-situ databases. In the current version this tool has the purpose of a demonstrator 
and is limited in functionality. Currently the In-Situ Client gives limited access to the [MERMAID In-Situ Database](http://mermaid.acri.fr/home/home.php)
hosted by ACRI-ST. Two datasets are available, namely BOUSSOLE and AERONET-OC.
* The Fractional Land/Water Mask Processor creates a new product based on the source product and computes a land/water mask. For each pixel, 
it contains the fraction of water; a value of 0.0 indicates land, a value of 100.0 indicates water, and every value in between indicates 
a mixed pixel.
